# Contributing to Satisfaculty

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide explains the open-source contribution workflow for those who may be new to it.

## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features

If you find a bug or have an idea, [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) on the repository. Please check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.

## The Fork & Pull Request Workflow

Open-source projects use a "fork and pull request" model. Here's the basic flow:

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own copy of the project on GitHub. See [GitHub's forking guide](https://docs.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

2. **Clone and set up** - Clone your fork locally and install in development mode with `pip install -e .`

3. **Create a branch** - Make your changes on a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) (not `master`).

4. **Make changes and push** - Edit the code, commit your changes, and push to your fork. Keep changes [small and focused](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/helping-others-review-your-changes) on a single goal.

5. **Submit a pull request** - Propose your changes back to the original repository. See [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

6. **Code review** - A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.
